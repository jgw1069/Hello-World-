# Hello-World-
Nice weather we are having, huh?

Hello and Welcome to my profile!

A little about me: Currently a college student who's starting on their journey to becoming a web developer or a front-end developer. Currently studying html & css at the moment and will be moving up to javascript soon. Right now I'm going to community college for general studies and plan on attending university in the spring, hopefully majoring in Graphic Design to get the basics down for design and other software programs. My hobbies are the usual such as videogames (mostly strategy type games) on the switch, going outside and taking walks and meeting new people via online or in real life. If there's any advice or you just want to chat don't hesitate to pm me or whatever github uses haha.
